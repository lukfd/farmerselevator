# Farmers Elevator

An application for grain elevators ([Grain elevator - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_elevator)) for giving them their own website and ecommerce to sell food for livestock to farmers.

The problem specifically arises today because farmers would need to call the elevator several times to complete an order. The order would take even longer in case it has been placed during the weekend.
